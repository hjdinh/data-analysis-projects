    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",

    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities."

    "- probability_less_6() — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "- making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\").\n",
    "- combining the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.\n",
    "- creating a function similar to probability_less_6() which calculates the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers. Hint: the number of successful outcomes for having at least four winning numbers is the sum of these three numbers:\n",
